Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns

The first Udacity Project from the Deep Learning Nanodegree.
Using only Numpy to implement forward and back propagation to predict Bike-Sharing Patterns.
The Neural network was built from "scratch", using only NumPy to assist. 
The goal of this project is to understand what happens behind the neural network before diving deeper into other tools like PyTorch.
